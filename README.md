# ⚡ eDaemon – Engine based on the Daemon System

Welcome to **eDaemon**: an engine designed for games of different types and platforms (Web, Unity, Unreal Engine, Mobile…), inspired and powered by the classic **Daemon System**, the first 100% Brazilian RPG system.  

If you came here expecting to summon spirits or try to hit a goblin with a d100 roll… well, you’re not entirely wrong. But the main goal here is to **bring the power of Daemon into the digital world**.

## 🎲 What is the Daemon System?

The **Daemon System** is a set of RPG rules created in Brazil by **Marcelo Del Debbio** back in '95. Unlike other non-brazilian systems, Daemon was designed to adapt to any game setting – from medieval sword & sorcery stories to cyberpunk, investigative horror, or epic battles with cosmic entities.  

Some key aspects of the Daemon System:
- ✅ **Universality** – the same ruleset can be used in any setting.  
- ✅ **Scalability** – works for quick campaigns or long sagas filled with NPCs and monsters.  
- ✅ **Simple math** – fast rolls without needing a calculator (unless you enjoy playing with Excel tables open).  
- ✅ **Official support and active community** – still alive today, with materials available on the [Daemon Wiki](https://wiki.daemon.com.br/index.php/Sistema_Daemon).

## 🚀 What is eDaemon?

**eDaemon** is an engine designed to **digitize and apply the Daemon System across different platforms**.  
Instead of keeping sheets and tables only on paper, this project aims to provide:
- 🎮 **Multiplatform integration** (Web, Unity, Unreal Engine, Mobile...).  
- 📑 **Management of rules, character sheets, and dice rolls** according to the Daemon System.  
- 🔌 **Extensibility** to be used not only for RPGs or MMORPGs but also for other genres (adventure, strategy, casual, etc.).  
- 🧩 **Modular foundation** usable both in games and auxiliary tools (generators, virtual game masters, etc.).  

In short: eDaemon is the **engine** that helps game masters and players bring digital life to stories that once lived only on paper and imagination.

## ☕ Project Philosophy

> "No coffee, no code. No code, no engine. No engine, no RPG. And without RPG… I don’t even want to think about it."  

eDaemon is built **on liters of coffee and a few shady pacts with the gods of debugging**.  
But don’t worry: no developers were sacrificed during the process (so far).
